## R Functions

This is a list of R functions that I have used in my project

## To install package from Bioconductor
```{r eval=FALSE}
BiocManager::install("package name")
```

## To view code for function without having to specify package
```{r eval=FALSE}
getAnywhere('function name')
```

## To only print code so that it is not executed
```{r eval=FALSE}
{r eval=FALSE}
```
